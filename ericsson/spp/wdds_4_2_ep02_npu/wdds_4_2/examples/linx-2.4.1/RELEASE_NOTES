RELEASE_NOTES

Enea LINX for Linux
-------------------

Version: 2.4.1
--------------

This is a release of Enea LINX for Linux open source package, containing
the LINX kernel module, LINX Ethernet Connection Manager (CM) module,
LINX TCP CM module, LINX shared memory CM module, the LINX RapidIO CM module,
the LINX library, tools for supervising and for configuring inter-node
communication and the LINX Gateway server.


Main Changes
------------

Added a RapidIO Connection Manager (sRIO CM). The sRIO CM is compatible with
the sRIO CM in the coming OSEck 4.1 C64x+ release. The Connection Manager have
been verified on Freescale P2010/TI C6486 hardware with customer drivers.

The sRIO message passing driver required by the Connection Manager is not
included in this release. For help obtaining such a driver please contact Enea.


Supported Linux Kernel Versions
-------------------------------

LINX version 2.4.0 supports vanilla kernels from 2.6.9 to 2.6.32. Vendor
specific kernels may require modifications in the LINX source code.


LINX Development Environment Requirements
-----------------------------------------

LINX does not use any unusual features and should be easy to build in any
modern self hosted or cross build environment.


LINX Known Bugs and Limitations
-------------------------------

Once a connection has been setup on an Ethernet interface, the interface's
MTU, address and name must not be changed (e.g. ifconfig eth1 mtu 1000). If
the LINX Ethernet CM detects such a change, it prints an error message to
the kernel ring buffer. Note that from now on, the behaviour of the affected
connections are unpredictable, e.g. signals may be truncated, etc. The only
way to ensure correct behaviour is to re-create the affected connections.

From one Ethernet interface, it is not possible to create multiple connections
to the same destination address. Same applies to TCP/IP CM (IP address instead
of MAC address etc.).

Some kernel versions and distributions require that LINX is built with
LINX_KERNEL_WORKAROUND_1 flag set to yes, see README.

The build option SOCK_STAT=yes is broken and should not be used.

The make system lacks proper dependencies.

If the LINXDISC daemon is killed with SIGKILL, it cannot be restarted due to
lack of cleanup. However, if the user removes the lockfile and established
LINX-connections, the daemon may be started again.
