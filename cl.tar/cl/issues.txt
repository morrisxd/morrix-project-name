[1] typedef can ONLY define one of struct_or_union and function. eg:
	typedef struct m {
	   int i;
	}m;
    or 
        typedef (*func)(int i);
    which means typedef can not define struct_or_union and function 
    at the SAME time.
[2] in typedef struct_or_union, there maybe a function declaration. eg
   typedef struct m {
      int (func)(int i);
   }
   This is legal. i have to clear the function declaration first 
   and then clear the struct typedef.
[3] i'm using function's parameter list as end of function declaration.
